description: |
  ◦ Developing a new Active Learning (AL)-based Federated Learning (FL) framework (METALS : seMi-supervised fEderaTed Active Learning for intrusion detection Systems) of the Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in IoT networks to combine semi-supervised learning and FL to take advantage of the strengths of both approaches
  <br>
  ◦ Conducted testing, benchmarking our model against state-of-the-art methodologies, including Classical Machine Learning
  models (Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN etc.), classical FL, and introducing new Active-based FL
