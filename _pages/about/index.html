<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hey folks! I am Gautam Jajoo, currently building a startup where we are tackling one of the hardest problems in AI i.e. <b>making time align with context so machines can reason, forecast, and predict the world better</b>. I am quite <b>fascinated</b> by building systems that truly grasp the underlying concepts of how the world works. I love building things at the intersection of tech, finance, and research.</p> <p><b>Education:</b> B.E. Computer Science &amp; M.Sc. Economics, BITS Pilani (2025)</p> <p><b>Research Interests:</b> These days, I am mostly working on Time Series Foundational Models, causal reasoning, and multi-agent systems. My journey has evolved quite a bit: I started with Federated Learning, Privacy-Preserving ML, and Causal Reasoning (heavily influenced by economics). From there, I moved into LLM reasoning, agentic reasoning and retrieval, and now deeper into temporal intelligence.</p> <p><b>Hobbies:</b> I love traveling, quizzing, playing chess (always up for a match — lichess: <i>gautamjajoo</i>), watching movies (I am a full-on movie buff), and writing jokes (I have even tried stand-up comedy!).</p> <p>Over the years, I have enjoyed taking part in competitions across product development, business case studies, finance, programming contests, data science, and analytics. I like exploring different problem spaces.</p> <p>I enjoy talking to people (not a full extrovert, but more of an ambivert). I bring energy and optimism wherever I go, and even on tough days I try to stay upbeat. I also live by the word <i>backhodi</i>: a Hindi term for light-hearted banter and silly jokes.</p> <p>I generally don’t find time to write a blog, but I do try to share my thoughts on <a href="https://x.com/gautam_jajoo/highlights" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">X</a>.
