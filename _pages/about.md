Hey folks! I am Gautam Jajoo, a final-year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani pursuing B.E. Computer Science and M.Sc. Economics. I like to code and love to work at the intersection of tech, business and research.

My research interests include Federated Learning, Privacy Preserving & Secure ML, and Causal Reasoning. I am also working on LLMs particularly prompt optimization and reasoning.

My hobbies include quizzing, playing chess, and watching movies(I am a movie buff ;)). Apart from that, I love writing jokes(I have even tried standup!).

I have actively participated in a diverse array of competitions spanning various domains, including product development, case studies, financial analysis, programming contests, and data analytics and science competitions.

I love to talk and interact with people(not an extrovert, but an ambivert). I bring plenty of energy and optimism to life, striving to stay upbeat even on tough days.

I am always looking opportunities to collaborate and work on interesting projects. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to say hi!
