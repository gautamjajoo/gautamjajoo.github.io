Hey folks! I am Gautam Jajoo, currently building a startup where we are tackling one of the hard problems in AI i.e. <b>making time align with context so machines can reason, forecast, and predict the world better</b>. I am quite <b>fascinated</b> by building something that can understand the underlying concepts of world better. I love building things at the intersection of tech, finance, and research.

<b>Education:</b> B.E. Computer Science & M.Sc. Economics, BITS Pilani

<b>Research Interests:</b> These days, I am mostly working on Time Series Foundational Models, causal reasoning, and agentic web search. My journey has evolved quite a bit: I started with Federated Learning, Privacy-Preserving ML, and Causal Reasoning (heavily influenced by economics). From there, I moved into LLM reasoning, multi-agent systems, and now deeper into temporal intelligence.

<b>Hobbies:</b> I love traveling, quizzing, playing chess (always up for a match — lichess: <i>gautamjajoo</i>), watching movies (I am a full-on movie buff), and writing jokes (I have even tried stand-up comedy!).

Over the years, I have enjoyed taking part in competitions across product development, business case studies, finance, programming contests, data science, and analytics. I like exploring different problem spaces.

I enjoy talking to people (not a full extrovert, but more of an ambivert). I bring energy and optimism wherever I go, and even on tough days I try to stay upbeat. I also live by the word <i>backhodi</i>: a Hindi term for light-hearted banter and silly jokes.

I generally don't find time to write a blog, but I do try to share my thoughts on [X](https://x.com/gautam_jajoo/highlights). Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to say hi! Here's my [Calendly](https://calendly.com/gautamjajoo1729/help).
